## 📖 About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/L5YrF7p.png)
![chrome_xw8FBQ0tul](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41302353/226617781-85908f5c-ec12-45d4-853c-8c8bb1b0b6a7.png)

This project is designed as a tool to simplify my role as a group leader. Responsible for tracking attendance at every session, I created this mini-application to automate the process of generating attendance lists with just a few clicks. This tool streamlines attendance tracking, saving time and effort, allowing me to focus on other responsibilities.

## 🚀 Usage

This application was created primarily for personal use. Lists can be modified directly within `SchedulePage.jsx`, and the application is not connected to a database. For local testing, the default login credentials are **username**: `tesla` and **password**: `modelx`. The app is also accessible online at [https://prezenta.mhlsq.me](https://prezenta.mhlsq.me) with different access credentials.
